<h1>Virtual Desktop AI Pet</h1>
<h2>Work in progress, may not represent final product</h2>

<h2>Description</h2>
I am developing a virtual desktop AI pet game on Unity. You can have your own AI characters roaming on your desktop and talk to them. The characters have emotions and they also have stats like health, thirst, energy etc. You can feed your character by either buying food from the shop or cook yourself in a cooking minigame. You can play some activities like fishing, cooking, combat, mining etc.
<br />


<h2>Tools used</h2>

- <b>Unity</b> 
- <b>Blender</b>
- <b>Figma</b>

<h2>Images and videos of the game</h2>

<h3> <p align="center">Cooking minigame </p> </h3>
<p align="center">Once you have enough ingredients for a recipe, you can start cooking it. Perform a qte for each ingredient that the recipe requires. Hitting all the qte's gives you a 3 star food, while missing qte's gives you a lower star food. You can get higher rarity food by using high rarity ingredients and getting a 3 star food. Higher rarity food has better stats and getting a legendary food even gives an extra stat. </p> <br/>
